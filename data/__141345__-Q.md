#### MISSING CHECKS FOR ADDRESS(0) WHEN ASSIGNING VALUES TO ADDRESS STATE VARIABLES

src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol
```solidity
172-175:
        CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ADDRESS = _circuitBreaker;
        COMPTROLLER_ADDRESS = _comptrollerAddress;
        TIME_LOCK_ADDRESS = _timeLockAddress;
        FRAXLEND_WHITELIST_ADDRESS = _fraxlendWhitelistAddress;

190-191:
        assetContract = IERC20(_asset);
        collateralContract = IERC20(_collateral);
```

These addresses are immutable, there is no way to change them if mistakenly set to 0 address. In which case may lead to redeployment of contracts.



#### EVENT IS MISSING INDEXED FIELDS


Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields.


```solidity
src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol
228:    event WithdrawFees(uint128 _shares, address _recipient, uint256 _amountToTransfer);

src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol
376-382:
        event AddInterest(
            uint256 _interestEarned,
            uint256 _rate,
            uint256 _deltaTime,
            uint256 _feesAmount,
            uint256 _feesShare
        );

389:    event UpdateRate(uint256 _ratePerSec, uint256 _deltaTime, uint256 _utilizationRate, uint256 _newRatePerSec);

696-701:
        event BorrowAsset(
            address indexed _borrower,
            address indexed _receiver,
            uint256 _borrowAmount,
            uint256 _sharesAdded
        );

760:    event AddCollateral(address indexed _sender, address indexed _borrower, uint256 _collateralAmount);

846:    event RepayAsset(address indexed _sender, address indexed _borrower, uint256 _amountToRepay, uint256 _shares);

897-904:
        event Liquidate(
            address indexed _borrower,
            uint256 _collateralForLiquidator,
            uint256 _sharesToLiquidate,
            uint256 _amountLiquidatorToRepay,
            uint256 _sharesToAdjust,
            uint256 _amountToAdjust
        );

1045-1052:
        event LeveragedPosition(
            address indexed _borrower,
            address _swapperAddress,
            uint256 _borrowAmount,
            uint256 _borrowShares,
            uint256 _initialCollateralAmount,
            uint256 _amountCollateralOut
        );

1143-1149:
        event RepayAssetWithCollateral(
            address indexed _borrower,
            address _swapperAddress,
            uint256 _collateralToSwap,
            uint256 _amountAssetOut,
            uint256 _sharesRepaid
        );
```

#### Residual debt shares after liquidation

There would be residual debt shares in the borrower balance after liquidation. Since repaid `_shares` in liquidation is at discount, `userBorrowShares[_borrower]` will not be 0 after liquidation.

src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol
```solidity
929-932:
        _collateralForLiquidator =
            (((_totalBorrow.toAmount(_shares, false) * _exchangeRate) / EXCHANGE_PRECISION) *
                (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) /
            LIQ_PRECISION;
```

It can be seen that `_shares` is discounted by:
```solidity
        (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION
```

Suggestion:
write off the residual debt shares in `userBorrowShares[_borrower]` after liquidation.
